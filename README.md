# Voidnodes MUD

Single-player text-based survival/base-building game. Science fantasy setting — survivors stranded on floating islands ("skerries") in the void between collapsed worlds.

## How to Run

```bash
python3 main.py
```

No external dependencies. Pure Python 3 stdlib.

## Core Concept

Two playable characters in alternating phases:
- **Sevarik** (Explorer phase) — combat, exploration, scavenging, recruitment
- **Miria** (Steward phase) — crafting, building, NPC management

A living **World Seed** grows as you feed it motes (energy from materials/artifacts). It anchors the skerry, communicates telepathically, and unlocks abilities across 5 growth stages (0→300 motes).

## Game Systems

### FATE Dice
Roll 4 Fudge dice (each -1/0/+1) + skill bonus vs difficulty. Aspects can be invoked (spend Fate Point) for +2. Opposed rolls for combat.

### Combat (Explorer phase)
`ATTACK` / `DEFEND` / `INVOKE` aspect / `EXPLOIT` aspect / `CONCEDE` / `RETREAT`

Damage flows: stress boxes (1/2/3) → consequences (mild/-2, moderate/-4, severe/-6) → Taken Out.

### Exploration
- `GO` direction within zones, `SEEK` aspect at Landing Pad to travel between zones
- `SCAVENGE` defeated rooms for materials, `PROBE` artifacts to reveal aspects
- `ENTER` artifact to find its location, `FEED` material to seed for motes

### Recruitment
Grid-based persuasion minigame. Navigate colored tiles (N/S/E/W), each color = conversational topic. Colors decay if unvisited; reach score threshold to recruit. Difficulty 0-3 scales grid size and color count.

### Base Building (Steward phase)
`CRAFT` from recipes (skill checks), `BUILD` expandable rooms (require materials + NPCs + seed stage), `ASSIGN` NPCs to tasks (gathering/crafting/guarding).

### World Seed Growth
5 stages: Baby(0) → Tendril(30) → Aura(75) → Voyager(150) → Sun(300 motes). Unlocks new aspects, stress boxes, communication depth.

## Commands

### Universal (all phases)
`LOOK` / `GO` / `INVENTORY` / `STATUS` / `CHECK` seed / `HELP` / `SAVE` / `DONE` / `QUIT` / `TALK` / `USE` / `WEAR` / `REMOVE` / `MAP` / `GIVE` / `SWITCH` / `OFFER` / `DROP` / `IH`

### Explorer-only
`ATTACK` / `DEFEND` / `INVOKE` / `EXPLOIT` / `CONCEDE` / `SCAVENGE` / `PROBE` / `FEED` / `KEEP` / `RECRUIT` / `RETREAT` / `ENTER` / `SEEK` / `TAKE`

### Steward-only
`CRAFT` / `RECIPES` / `BUILD` / `ASSIGN` / `ORGANIZE` / `TRADE`

### Aliases
Movement: `n/s/e/w/u/d`. Look: `l/x`. Inventory: `i/inv`. Take: `get/grab/pick`. Equip: `equip→wear`. Flee: `flee/run→retreat`. Examine: `examine→probe`.

## World Map

**Home — The Skerry:** Central Clearing, Shelter, Hollow (seed), Junkyard, Landing Pad + 4 expandable rooms (Workshop, Garden, Water Collection, Lookout Post)

**Void Zones:**
1. **Debris Field** (easy) — dead ship, 5 rooms. Enemies: rats, hounds, automatons. Artifact: Stabilization Engine.
2. **Coral Thicket** (medium) — bioluminescent ecosystem. Artifact: Growth Lattice.
3. **Frozen Wreck** (hard) — ancient ship in void-ice. Artifact: Eliok House (major feed-vs-keep choice).

## Architecture Notes

**Game loop:** `start() → _hydrate() → run() → parse → cmd_*() → tutorial.after_command()`. Save via `_dehydrate()`.

**Mixin pattern:** `Game` class in `main.py` inherits from 10 mixin classes in `commands/`. Each mixin defines `cmd_*` handlers for a command group. All `self.*` state lives in `Game.__init__` — mixins don't define `__init__`. Command dispatch via `getattr(self, f"cmd_{cmd}")` resolves handlers across all mixins.

**Phase system:** `prologue` (tutorial) → `explorer` / `steward` alternating. `DONE` advances day and switches.

**Data-driven:** All content (NPCs, zones, items, recipes, events) defined in JSON. Code handles mechanics; JSON handles content.

**Each command is its own handler** — `cmd_attack()`, `cmd_offer()`, etc. Do NOT alias new commands to existing ones; Eleanor wants them to diverge independently.

## Design Decisions

- **OFFER is not FEED** — separate verbs, separate handlers, even if similar
- **Each verb gets its own command** — no combining or aliasing new functionality onto existing commands
- **FATE system faithful** — aspects, invokes, exploit advantages, consequences all work per FATE Core rules
- **Recruit minigame uses compass directions** (N/S/E/W), not WASD
- **Tutorial is thorough** — 3 acts, teaches seed bonding → exploration → steward phase
